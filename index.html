          <h1>Hearken to me, ye who follow after rightness and justice!</h1>
          <p class="proclamation">
            Loath vassals in the midden, thy treasures heaped against<br>
            Thy purloined post unbidden, my humors grow incensed<br>
            The child of my child, yet toils in thy field<br>
            Grasping plow at home, in thy wars a shield<br>
            <br>
            Swollen, my sword arm has grown<br>
            Reaping from tillage in spring I had sown<br>
            Still one stalk remains to be felled<br>
            And in its seeds my birthright is held<br>
            <br>
            Vacant aspects stare callous to our mortal plight<br>
            Endless labor unrewarded picturing no end in sight<br>
            The scars upon this flesh thy lash no more can batter<br>
            Renewal waits enkindled atop thy kingdom's ashes scattered<br>
            <br>
            And chansons of my forebears do ring in mine ears<br>
            Drudges to their seigneurs from first to final years</p>
